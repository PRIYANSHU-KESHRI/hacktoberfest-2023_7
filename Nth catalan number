Given a number N. The task is to find the Nth catalan number.
The first few Catalan numbers for N = 0, 1, 2, 3, … are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, …

Catalan Number for N is equal to the number of expressions containing N pairs of paranthesis that are correct matched, i.e., for each of the N '(' there exist N ')' on there right and vice versa.

Since answer can be huge return answer modulo 1e9+7.

Note: Positions start from 0 as shown above.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Output: 42



def nthCatalanNumber(N):
    mod = 10**9 + 7
    
    # Initialize the Catalan number array
    catalan = [0] * (N + 1)
    
    # Base case
    catalan[0] = catalan[1] = 1
    
    # Calculate Catalan numbers using dynamic programming
    for i in range(2, N + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            catalan[i] = (catalan[i] + catalan[j] * catalan[i - j - 1]) % mod
    
    return catalan[N]

# Example usage
N = 5
result = nthCatalanNumber(N)
print(result)
